## 🧙‍♂️ Future Age Fortune Teller – Instructions

### 🎯 Project Objective:
You will create a small JavaScript project that predicts how old you’ll be in a future year using variables and basic math.

---

### 📝 What You Need to Do:

1. **Create a variable for your name.**  
   → It should be a text value (a string).

2. **Create a variable for your birth year.**  
   → This will be a number (for example: 2007).

3. **Create a variable for the current year.**  
   → Use the present year (example: 2025).

4. **Create a variable for a future year you choose.**  
   → Pick any year you want to know your age in (example: 2035).

5. **Calculate your current age.**  
   → Use subtraction to find how old you are this year.

6. **Calculate your age in the future year.**  
   → Again, use subtraction to find how old you'll be in the year you picked.

7. **Print friendly messages to the console.**  
   → Tell your name, current age, and future age in a fun way using messages.

### 💡 Bonus Challenge:
- Try changing the years to see different results.
